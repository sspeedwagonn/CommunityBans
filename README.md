# CommunityBans

In progress :)

CommunityBans is a plugin made to unite Minecraft server punishment databases into one unifying website where all punishments are searchable via player name or UUID. Alternatively, server administrators can opt to keep their punishments private and create a private website via this plugin.

CommunityBans also works with popular punishment plugins to convert actions taken from them into usable information for the website. That way, server administrators don't have to give up systems they are already comfortable with!
